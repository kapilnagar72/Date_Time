# Date_Time_API

1.What is enums in java? explain with an example
Ans: We can use enum to define a group of named constants.
Enums are used to represent a collection of related constants that have a common purpose. Each constant in an
enum is an instance of the enum type, and they are typically defined as public static final fields.

2.What are in built annotations in java
Ans: built-in annotations in Java:
@Override
@Deprecated
@SuppressWarnings
@FunctionalInterface
@Retention
@Target
@Documented
@Inherited
These built-in annotations in Java are used to provide additional information to the Java compiler and other
tools. They help improve code readability, maintainability, and safety by enforcing specific rules and behaviours
in Java code.
